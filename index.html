            You Promised is a platform that archives and categorizes the public statements of corporations and other institutions
            created in response to the 2020 movement for Black Lives, protests against state-sanctioned police murders of 
            George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Tony McDade, and countless others, and the continuing struggles to dismantle systemic racism. 
            Many institutions have released well-intended promises of equity and anti-racist objectives, but a statement is not enough. 
            You Promised Us is a dynamic tool for communities and workers to report, track, and assess the promises of their institutions 
            and hold them accountable for the work we demand they do.
